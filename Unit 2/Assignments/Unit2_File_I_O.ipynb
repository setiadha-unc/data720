    "* The objective of this quiz is for you to write code that reads data from a file and does simple analysis on the data.\n",
    "* The name of the file is `Unit2_city_weather_data.csv`.\n",
    "* The file contains weather data for two North Carolina cities.\n",
    "* The file is in the CSV format.\n",
    "* The file has three columns: a date, a city and the temperature for that city and date.\n",
    "* Your code should do the following:\n",
    "    * Read the data from Unit2_city_weather_data.txt.\n",
    "    * Extract the date, city, and temperature values.\n",
    "    * Calculate the average temperature for each city.\n",
    "    * Print out the average temperature for each city.\n",
    "    * Identify and print the dates for each city where the temperature was above the city's average.\n",
    "* **Note: Do not use Pandas to read in data**"
