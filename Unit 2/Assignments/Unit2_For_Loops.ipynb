    "## Unit 2 For Loops Quiz\n",
    "* The objective of this quiz is for you to write code that implements a number guessing game.\n",
    "* The objective of the game is for the player to guess a randomly chosen number within a given number of guesses.\n",
    "* Your program should do the following:\n",
    "    * Print a suitable message that explains the rules of the game.\n",
    "    * Generate a random number within a specified range.\n",
    "        * Consider using the Python function `randint` from the [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module. Example usage is shown below.\n",
    "        * To begin with, assume that the range is from 0-100 and the player has to guess it within 6 guesses.\n",
    "    * Create a `for` loop that:\n",
    "        * Prompts the player to enter a guess.\n",
    "        * Checks if the entered value is equal to the randomly chosen value, greater than it or less than it.\n",
    "        * Provide feedback to the user on how the enetered value is related to the randomly chosen value.\n",
    "        * Exit the `for` loop if the guess is correct or the number of guesses exceeds the allowed number.\n",
    "    * Present a suitable message to the player about their success or failure in guessing the number.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Test you code for different values of the range within which the random integer lies, and differeent numbers of allowed guesses.."
