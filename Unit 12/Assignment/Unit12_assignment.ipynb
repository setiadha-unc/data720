    "## Unit 12 Count the number of components in an undirected graph\n",
    "* The objective of this programming assignment is for you to write code that creates a graph from a text file, and computes the number of connected components.\n",
    "* You will use two graphs as examples for your code. Each graph is stored in a text file as described below.\n",
    "* You can assume that the graphs are undirected and unweighted, and that there are no isolated vertices.\n",
    "* The two graph files are `one_graph.txt` and `two_graph.txt`.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Each line in the graph text file will have two values which are alphanumeric and separated by at least one whitespace character.\n",
    "    * Each alphanumeric value in the line represents a node.\n",
    "    * Each line in the file represents an edge between the two nodes in that line.\n",
    "    * So for example, a text file such as:\n",
    "        * A1 A2\n",
    "        * A3 A4\n",
    "        * A4 A1\n",
    "    * is a graph with 4 nodes, A1, A2, A3, A4, and with edges connecting A1 and A2, A3 and A4 and A4 and A1\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "* An algorithm for computing the number of connected components in a graph is as follows:\n",
    "    * Set `no_connected_components` to 0\n",
    "    * Create an empty set `visited` to track nodes that have been visited\n",
    "    * For each vertex, `v`,  in the graph:\n",
    "        * if `v` is not in `visited`:\n",
    "            * increment `no_connected_components` by 1\n",
    "            * do a depth first search from `v`, adding each node you visit to the `visited` set\n",
    "    * At the end of the for loop, `no_connected_components` will have the number of connected components in the graph.\n",
    "    * Print out `no_connected_components`\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "* You should organize your code appropriately to show a clean and thoughtful design.\n",
    "    * Use functions as needed.\n",
    "    * Break up into cells so smaller pieces can be easily tested.\n",
    "    * Add the appropriate documentation to make your code comprehensible."
